<p>I have attempted, in this small volume, to give a true and impartial
history of the brief but glorious career of our Regiment.
Though called into the field at a late hour, the services of the
Regiment have been arduous and severe, in the extreme, and, participating,
as it has done, in the last closing scenes of the rebellion,
it has shared in the honor and glory of winding up the secession
movement.</p>

<p>These memoirs have been mostly compiled from memory, with
the assistance of the regimental and company records, and the
reminiscences of my brother officers.</p>

<p>For the literary excellence of the work, I claim no merit, as I
have not endeavored to accomplish more than the title of the
work sets forth: a plain "History of the 37th Regiment Wisconsin
Volunteer Infantry." As such a record, it may, I hope, be
kindly received among those whose deeds it sets forth; further
than that I care little for its fate.</p>

<p>A few years, and the scenes of this rebellion will become misty
and indistinct, through the veil of years; a few more, and it will
have become a matter of history, minor details and incidents being
lost and absorbed in the great broad facts of the period.
Then, the author has a hope, a vain one if you will, but springing
from the pardonable vanity of a parent in the offspring of his
brain, that such records as this will be prized as this generation
is passing away, and those who have shared in the stirring events
of the time it treats of, may,</p>

<p>In the spring of 1864, a call having been made by the
President for 500,000 fresh troops, his Excellency, James
T. Lewis, issued an order for the raising of a regiment
to be designated the 37th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry.</p>

<p>To Sam. Harriman, of Somerset, St. Croix county,
Captain of company A, 30th Wisconsin, was entrusted
the charge of raising this regiment, and a commission as
Colonel issued to him on the 7th of March.</p>

<p>The work of recruiting was immediately entered into
with vigor, and, on the 13th of April, 1864, the first
company, (company, B, Capt. R. C. Eden,) was mustered
into the service of the United States, at the rendezvous
at Madison, by Capt. T. T. Brand, "for three
years, unless sooner discharged." On the afternoon of
the same day, company C, Capt. John Green, was also
mustered in by the same officer, followed on the 12th of
the same month by company D, Capt. Alvah Nash, on
the 16th by company A, Capt. S. Stevens, on the 18th
by company E, Capt. Frank A. Cole, on the 19th by
company F, Capt. E. Burnett, on the 3d of May by
company G, Capt. W. W. Heller, and company H, Capt.
Frank T. Hobbs, on the 5th of May by company K,
Capt. A. A. Burnett, and on the 6th of the same month
by company I, Capt. Geo. A. Beck.</p>

<p>On the 28th of April, companies A, B, C, D, E, and
F left Camp Randall, under command of Major Kershaw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and proceeded to Washington, where they arrived on the
1st of May, and were encamped on Arlington Heights,
in the neighborhood of the Long Bridge. Colonel Harriman
accompanied the regiment as far as Chicago, from
which place he returned to Madison, to superintend the
organization of the four remaining companies. The journey
was accomplished in safety and without the occurrence
of any noteworthy incident. On the 17th, the detachment
was joined by companies H and I, and arms
and accoutrements being at once issued to the men, the
instruction of the regiment in the manual and battalion
drill was at once proceeded with, with vigor. Lieut. Col.
Doolittle, having joined the regiment at Chicago, assumed
the command then and there, taking charge of the disciplining
and instructing of the eight companies, of which
it was then composed.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, orders were received for the regiment
to prepare for the field, and to be ready to march
by the next morning. The comfortable "wedge" and
"wall" tents in which men and officers had been luxuriating
and gaining their first experience of camp life were,
accordingly, turned in to the Regimental Quartermaster,
and the fragmentary and disjointed dwellings, known to
the polite world as shelter tents, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'tents d'abri'">tentes d'abri</ins></i>, but
known amongst soldiers as <em>pup tents</em>, were issued in their
stead. All extra baggage was disposed of, and the comforts
of civilized life bid adieu to, "for three years unless
sooner discharged."</p>

<p>At daylight, on the morning of the 29th, we took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
our line of march for Alexandria, thus entering on our
first campaign. The morning was sunny and clear, and
as the sun gained power, became unpleasantly warm, and
a source of no little distress to men unused to marching
and the encumbrance of gun, knapsack and accoutrements,
as ours were. About ten o'clock, we arrived in the suburbs
of Alexandria, where we rested for an hour or two,
awaiting orders as to our further disposition.</p>

<p>The transports on which we were to embark for White
House Landing, on the Pamunkey River, the then base
of supplies of the Army of Virginia, had arrived the
night previous and were then engaged in taking on board
a large herd of cattle, which was to form part of their
live freight, and we were accordingly ordered into camp
on the banks of the river where we remained till 5 o'clock
on the afternoon of the 30th. The work of embarking
the troops was then commenced, and our Regiment was
divided into three divisions, which were distributed as
follows: Companies B and E were assigned to the propeller
<i>S. Cloud</i>, under command of Capt. Eden, of company
B; the propeller <i>Andrew Harder</i> carried companies A,
C, D and F, under command of Lieut. Col. Doolittle,
while Capt. Hobbs took command of the remainder of
the detachment on board of the <i>Charles Osgood</i>.</p>

<p>With the exception of the <i>Harder's</i> grounding on a
sand bank just above Mt. Vernon, and nearly involving
the <i>Cloud</i>, which came to her assistance, in a like catastrophe,
no incident, unpleasant or otherwise, occurred to
mar the tranquility of our passage down the Potomac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>We made a pleasant run down Chesapeake Bay, and
the morning of the second of June found us, after a close
escape from grounding on York Spit,&mdash;a long narrow
point of sand off the mouth of York River,&mdash;preparing
to anchor off Yorktown to wait for a pilot to conduct us
up the intricate navigation of the York and Pamunkey
Rivers. The original intention had been for us to follow
up the <i>Harder</i>, the only vessel in the squadron that carried
a government pilot, but owing to her neglecting to
display a proper signal, during the night, we had lost
sight of her and were consequently left to our own resources.</p>

<p>Our preparations for anchoring were yet in course of
completion when the pilot was seen, coming out of Yorktown,
and the squadron was again headed up the York
River. About noon we passed West Point, an insignificant
collection of small dwellings, situated on a long
point of land between the York and Pamunkey rivers,
and just at their junction. From this point to White
House Landing the Pamunkey is, perhaps, as crooked a
river as can be found in the United States. The channel,
however, is straight and deep, running between low, flat
marshes occasionally relieved with high, steep banks and
well wooded bluffs, capital points for guerrilla operations.</p>

<p>Rumors were rife as to the exploits of these gentry, in
this neighborhood, and the several divisions of the detachment
received orders to load, many of them then performing
that operation for the first time. The size of
our squadron, however, and the presence of several "tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>-clads"
and "double enders," those "restless wanderers
of the <em>deeps</em>" and shallows, tended no doubt to awe the
bushwhackers and keep them on their best behavior.</p>

<p>At any rate the Thirty-Seventh passed along, unmolested
and unmolesting, except when an insubordinate
recruit would insist on trying the range of Springfield or
(contraband) Colt on sundry and divers vagabond members
of the porcine tribe, that seemed to lead an aimless
and unsatisfactory life, on the banks of the Pamunkey.
And so the long summer's day passed away, with the hot
perpendicular rays of the sun shining down on our bare
decks, unchecked by awning or shelter of any kind, frying
the pitch out of the deck seams and reducing the tar
in the rigging to the consistency of molasses and leaving
about as pleasant an impression on the incautious hands
of those who ventured to touch strand or stay. But "all
things come to an end," says the wise man, and so even
will a long hot summer day, if it is passed on board a
crowded transport, with a scarcity of standing, sitting or
lying room, a still greater scarcity of drinkable water,
and an utter absence of anything at all approaching to
comfort.</p>

<p>About 5 P. M., a sudden turn in the river brings us
in sight of the chimneys of what once was the White
House, from which the landing, which is for the present
to be our destination, takes its name. A few more throbbing,
restless pulsations of our propeller's wheel, and its
action grows fainter and slower as, amidst a crowd of
steamers, propellers, tug-boats, schooners, barges, scows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
skiffs, and all the crowd of craft incident to a base of supplies,
we work our way up to the landing. Again a few
more revolutions of the wheel, a jar and a crash accompanied
by a few nautical expletives, and we grind alongside
of a sutler's barge, blundering down stream, without
any apparent directing power or any definite object in
view; till at length one of the never-resting, spiteful
looking, ever-watchful tug-boats darts out from some labyrinth
of hulls, pounces on it and drags it away, awkward
and clumsy and apparently remonstrating and
resisting to the last, into its proper and designated mooring
place. Then a sudden cessation of the, to all appearance,
endless jar and throb of the screw, a tangled
web of heaving-lines flying through the air, a deafening
roar as the pent up steam raises the valve and comes
tumbling out at the escape pipe and eddies and whirls
about as if for pure joy at its liberation from restraint;
a few more double-shotted nautical expletives, a vast
amount of veering and hauling on heavy hawsers and the
transports are made fast and our voyage ended.</p>

<p>But, if the confusion on the river was great, that on
the shore was certainly, to all appearances, much greater.
Mule drivers, addressing their jaded teams by every
soothing and endearing epithet in the well stocked vocabulary
of their class, and the mules replying in their
scarcely less intelligible, and much less profane, dialect;
long wagon trains, coming and going in every direction;
colored laborers, rolling barrels on to every bodies' toes,
their own included, and becoming the patient recipients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of remarks objurgatory of their eyes and limbs, therefor.
Long lines of stretchers loaded with wounded being carried
on board two large hospital steamers, loading for
Washington; ambulances arriving from the front, with
fresh cases; orderlies, hot and dusty, riding, walking, or
running in every direction; clouds of dust and smoke,
from camp fires and steamboats; shouting, braying, swearing,
yelling, (from the mules) whistling from the steamboats,
combined altogether to form a scene of noise and
confusion, to which the grand finale at the tower of Babel
was, by comparison, nothing but a quiet assemblage of
sober and well behaved mechanics. Threading our way,
with no little difficulty, through this motley assemblage,
we at length gained a quiet and comparatively secluded
spot where we were, much to our relief, ordered to camp;
and this we, nothing loth, proceeded at once to do.</p>

<p>Here we remained, guarding prisoners and picketing
along the line of the Richmond railroad, till the 10th of
June; here we, for the first time, heard the sound of
shotted guns, as the terrible battle of the 3d of June
surged and roared, nearly twenty miles away, in our
front. And all that night, and part of the 4th, the long
trains of ambulances, each bearing its ghastly load of
bleeding and suffering men, rolled through our camp, giving
us our first insight into the horrors of war, in which
we were soon to take an active part. Here, too, we had
a first insight into the heroism and patience under suffering
of those who form our armies; numbers of slightly
wounded, or, who at least were not absolutely prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
from traveling by the loss of limbs, came straggling
through our camps, many only just able to limp along;
some with hands or arms bandaged; others with ugly cuts
on the head or face, their hair all matted and tangled,
soaked with blood and clogged with the dust of the road,
hungry, thirsty, weary and suffering, but uttering no
complaints, and patient and cheerful under it all.</p>

<p>And in the Depot Hospital at the landing we had an
opportunity of witnessing the heroic and charitable part
the women of America were taking in the war. No
matter how ragged or dirty the sufferer, how hideous or
revolting the wound, alive in many instances with maggots,
and in every form of putrefaction and mortification;
no matter what nation or country the patient belonged to;
woman's kind, ministering hand was there, to wash the
festering wound, to bathe the toil-worn feet, to comb the
matted locks, hold the cooling draught to the parched
lips, or to receive the last words that fell from them e'er
they were closed forever. And this without reward or
hire, or expectation of it, their only recompense the
consciousness of obeying the mandate that makes charity
our duty, their only reward the knowledge that they are
aiding to maintain the government and preserve the integrity
of the stars and stripes.</p>

<p>But we linger too long around White House Landing
and scenes, which, though then novel and strange to us,
have since become a part of our every day life. On the
10th of June, we were dispatched from the base as guard
to a supply train, under charge of Capt. Alex. Samuels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the 5th Wisconsin, which was on its way to the front
at Cool Arbor, or Cold Harbor, as it is sometimes written.
Much dispute has been held, as to the orthography
and derivation of the name of this place, it being called
indiscriminately Cool Arbor, Cold Harbor, Cool Harbor,
and Coal Harbor. The first would, however, seem to be
the most appropriate designation, as there is no Harbor,
nor any navigable stream to convert into one, within ten
miles of the place. I have been informed by a Virginian
who is acquainted with the locality, that the name originated
as follows:</p>

<p>Cool Arbor, which is nothing more than a large farm
house or tavern on one of the main highways leading to
Richmond, was originally built by an Englishman, as a
place of summer resort for the citizens of that place, and
named by him Cool Arbor, from its pleasant and shady
location. The proverbial (H)english disregard of the
use of the aspirate probably converted the second word
of the name into Harbor, and a broad provincial dialect
would easily effect the transition from Cool to Coal or
Cold. Its claim to either title is now a poor one, for
trees and farm have both alike disappeared, and in the
words of the poet, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perierunt etiam ruinæ</i>"&mdash;the very
ruins are gone.</p>

<p>At this place we arrived in safety after a long and tedious
march of nearly twenty miles, along a heavy, sandy
road plentifully bestrewn with dead mules, wagons broken
or stuck in the swamps, and abandoned, and all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">debris</i>
usually to be seen on the line of communication between
a large army and its base. Our march was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
marked by the incidents common to such a trip; an overturned
wagon now and then to be righted, or a broken-down
mule to be led to the roadside and shot; a vexatious
delay of perhaps half an hour, to make some repair
to harness or wheels, and then a forced march for a mile
or two to catch up with the rest of the train.</p>

<p>To any one that has never tried it, the task of guarding
a wagon train may, perhaps, be recommended as an
amusement, on the score of novelty, but we hardly think
it is one that can be either pleasantly or profitably followed
up, as a steady trade.</p>

<p>On arriving at Cool Arbor we were assigned to the 1st
Brigade, 3d Division of the 9th, or Burnside's, Army
Corps, temporarily attached to the Army of the Potomac,
though in reality belonging to no army in particular, and
better known amongst military men as "Burnside's
Traveling Menagerie," so called, not from the heterogeneous
collection composing it, but from the wandering nature
of the service it had been engaged in since its organization.
Our Division Commander was Brig. Gen.
O. B. Willcox, of the regular army, since promoted to
be Brevet Major General, and our Brigade Commander,
Brig. Gen. John F. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Hartrauft'">Hartranft</ins>, afterwards Major General of
Volunteers, commanding the Third Provisional Division
of the 9th Army Corps.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th of June we were ordered
from the position we held on the flank, into the front line
of works, where we had the pleasure of listening to the
music of shot and shell, and of inspecting a rebel line
of fortifications, for the first time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE SIEGE OF PETERSBURG</span>.</h2>


<p>On the evening of the 12th of June, just as we had
settled ourselves down, to pass, as best we might, our
first night in the trenches, and amid the roar of artillery
and the uncouth yells of the combatants, to snatch a few
hours' much needed sleep, we received orders to pack up
and be ready to march an hour after sundown, to exercise
the utmost caution in our movements, and to allow no
talking nor rattling of arms, accoutrements or equipage
to be heard, bayonets to be unfixed and arms carried at
the trail.</p>

<p>And it was so. Quietly and stealthily on that still
June evening the whole Army of the Potomac stole away
from under the dark sombre pine woods where it laid encamped,
and commenced its flank march on Petersburg.
Our road, for the first ten or twelve miles, lay in the direction
of White House Landing, and, except that we
kept to the fields, the roads being occupied by our trains
and artillery, was almost a repetition of our route from
the Landing to the front.</p>

<p>Just short of White House, however, we turned
sharp to the right and kept away for Baltimore and Kent
Cross Roads and Charles City Court House. At the last
named place we were delayed some twelve hours by the
2d Corps supply train failing to connect, thus affording
us a rest, which, however much it may have disconcerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the plans of the Lieutenant General, was very acceptable
to the men, on whom the long and rapid marching was
beginning to tell.</p>

<p>We resumed our march about an hour before sundown
on the afternoon of the 15th, and at dark were crossing
the James River on the pontoons laid over it at Harrison's
Landing. Our course then lay along the left bank
of the river and parallel to it, leaving City Point on our
right and bringing us up to the front of the city of
Petersburg, about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of the 16th
of June.</p>

<p>Our sufferings on this day's march, from heat, thirst
and fatigue combined, were severe in the extreme, but,
to the credit of our regiment, with the exception of one
or two cases of sun stroke, not a man fell out, or was
missing when we arrived at our final destination.</p>

<p>We had hardly halted and commenced preparations for
supper when we were ordered to move on to support a
charge about to be made by the 4th, or colored division, of
our corps, and so marched about a mile further, formed
line of battle in a piece of pine woods and awaited orders.
But a short time had elapsed before a confused cheer, or
rather yell, in our front followed by a dropping fire of
musketry and a few rounds from the artillery told that
the ball had opened and that our turn might arrive any
minute. The firing, however, gradually died away without
our services being required, and we shortly learned
that the sable gentry had been successful and had carried
the first line of the defences of Petersburg. Supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that our services would not be further required, we proceeded
to prepare our long deferred and much desired
supper, but hardly had the scent of the coffee&mdash;the great
stand-by and panacea of the soldiery&mdash;become perceptible to
our expectant senses, before the unwelcome order came
for us again to move and hold the line of works the colored
troops had taken. With many a sigh, the tempting
decoction of the Arabian herb was consigned to the sacred
soil of Virginia&mdash;in plain English we threw away
our coffee&mdash;and with many an insubordinate growl and
execration on the "exigencies of the service," we started
for our new scene of labors. A few solid shot and
shell, and one or two rounds of case and canister were
pitched at us as we moved up to the works, which beyond
creating some slight consternation, did no damage whatever,
and, having occupied the old line of rebel works, we
passed the night without molestation and in comparative
peace.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 17th June, the brigade
was formed in line of battle, in a ravine, preparatory to
charging a line of works, extending from the Bagster
Road almost to Hare Hill, the future site of Fort Steadman.
This line of works was situated in the middle of a
field of corn, then just in the tassel, on the crest of a
ridge or slight elevation, and was built in the shape of
the letter V, the apex of the line being towards the rear.
To the right and left of the line were batteries, and
another in a narrow section of pine woods covered the
centre of the line. Though not very strongly manned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the work was a heavy one, and from its commanding position
and the heavy enfilading fire that could be brought
to bear on almost any part of it, not by any means an
easy one to carry. Our line was however formed, and we
stood there, the hot bright sun almost blinding us and
heating the dry sand under our feet, till it almost blistered
them, awaiting the orders to commence our first
battle. A desultory fire was being kept up by a line of
skirmishers and sharpshooters entrenched a little in advance
of our line and a round of spherical case or canister
would occasionally come whistling over our heads,
spattering sharply and viciously through the timber close
in our rear and making the limbs and splinters fly far and
wide. At length the preparations were all made, and
with beating hearts we waited for the word; it came at
last: "Forward, double quick! charge!" a wild, loud
cheer, rolls along from one end to the other of the brigade,
a sudden trampling of feet breaks in on the comparative
quiet of the summer's morning, a few seconds and
the line of works in our front becomes wreathed in smoke,
as we mount a low bank which had hitherto concealed it
from our view;&mdash;an angry roar from the batteries in the
woods in front of us, and an hailstorm of shot, shell,
grape, canister, and minie balls screaming through the
air above and around us and throwing up clouds of dust,
as they strike the sand in every direction, till the whole
battle field is obscured by a heavy cloud of dust and
smoke through which the rebel works in front of us and
their truculent looking butternut defenders are barely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
discernible. And through it all the wild cheering yell of
our boys as they pant and struggle on through the deep
sand, which fills mouth and nostrils, almost suffocating
us; the crash and roar of cannon and musketry, the bursting
of shells, the whiz of the missiles as they pass, the
cries of the wounded as they roll over in their agony, all
blended and mingling together, yet each sound distinct
and clear as if the only one to break the stillness of the
summer air. But no words can paint a battle any more
than can canvas portray its details, which only those
who have participated in can appreciate or understand.
On we go,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"On, on, through the hell-fire of shrapnel and shell</p>
<p class="verse">On without faltering, right on with a yell,"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">till we see the scowling, wolfish looking faces of the rebels
in their works, till their fire slackens, till we can see
the artillerymen working the guns of the battery on our
left limbering up their pieces and starting to the rear,
till the right of their line breaks slowly from their works
and retires to the rear.</p>

<p>Then comes an order "half wheel to the right," a
wavering confused movement along the whole line, a yell
of derision from the Rebels, a sudden recommencement
of their fire; and, with victory within its grasp, the brigade
falls back on the line of works they lately left confident
of victory, shattered and broken and leaving hundreds
of its numbers on the field.</p>

<p>From whom the order came directing the movement to
the right has never, I believe, been satisfactorily estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>lished,
but to this order, exposing the whole brigade, as
it did, to a most severe enfilading fire, may be attributed
the failure of the charge and the heavy loss sustained by
the brigade. Our leading files were close up to the works,
the Rebels were withdrawing their men and guns, and had
we but been allowed to go right ahead, we should have
taken the whole and suffered much less loss than we did.
Had we done so, our entrance into Petersburg that afternoon
would have been easily accomplished, as the troops
opposed to us were nothing but the Petersburg Reserves,
raw militia, and few in number.</p>

<p>Our regiment suffered severely in this its first day's
fight. Major Kershaw was shot through the legs; Lieut.
Colonel Doolittle was slightly wounded in the shoulder
and had his shoulder strap torn off by a piece of a shell;
Lieut. Earl, Co. B, received a gunshot wound which
caused his death shortly afterwards; Lieut. F. B. Riddle,
Co. C, was mortally wounded, and Capt. Green received
a slight contusion from a piece of shell.</p>

<p>In this engagement Serg't Greene, of company C, the
Regimental Color Bearer, was shot through both legs by
a grape shot, in the early part of the fight; unable to
walk and fearful lest the colors entrusted to his charge,
should fall into the hands of the enemy, he rolled up the
flag on the staff and seizing this in his teeth, drew himself
off the field and behind the works into a place of
safety. Such unselfish heroism is deserving the highest
commendation, though poor Greene lived barely long
enough to know that his courageous act was known and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
appreciated. Our loss in killed and wounded in this battle
amounted to 138 of which number 44 were killed on
the field and 10 died from the effects of their wounds.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that a more disheartened and, for the
time, broken down set of men ever met together, than
the scattered fragments of our regiment when we collected
in the ravine after our ill-fated charge on the first day
of the battle of Petersburg. Our men had been marched
for four successive days and nights, had had little or no
sleep for five, and been on short rations for the same period.
To this may be added that depressed feeling, the
natural sequence of great excitement, which always follows
a battle, even if successful; the loss of so many of our
number, and a feeling that would creep in&mdash;that there
had been a blunder, somewhere.</p>

<p>We remained in the ravine for an hour or two, getting
rest and refreshment, of both of which we stood in much
need. Towards night, however, we were ordered forward
to support the Second Division who had advanced their
works some way up the field. We accordingly took possession
of a partially constructed breastwork on the edge
of the ravine, and after an hour or two employed in further
completing and strengthening our defences, lay down
to get what rest we could to prepare us for what the
morrow might have in store for us. We slept that night,
without rocking, and a heavy fire that the enemy opened
on our lines during the night, hardly awakened us. At
daylight we were roused up and ordered to advance in
line of battle, with two companies deployed as skirmish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>ers,
which order, however, was afterwards modified by
the 8th Michigan being deployed along the whole Brigade
front.</p>

<p>We advanced steadily and slowly over the scene of yesterday's
battle and found the line of works for which we
had then contended unoccupied, except by the rebel dead,
who were pretty thickly piled up all along the works.
We entered the woods I have before mentioned as being
in the rear of the defenses, in which we found traces of a
large camp, which had evidently been abandoned in great
haste. Muster rolls and other military records, more or
less complete, were scattered round in every direction,
cooking utensils and a variety of eatables lay round everywhere,
forming, with worn out clothing and accoutrements
and the remains of the huts and tents, a lively picture
of confusion and ruin.</p>

<p>A brisk fire on the skirmish line showed that we were
fast approaching the scene of action, and on reaching the
edge of the timber we were ordered to build breastworks
and await the arrival of Gen. Bartlett's command on our
right. The day was clear and bright, and, owing to a
light northerly breeze, not unpleasantly warm. Our boys
soon threw up a light line of works and lay down under
the shade of the pines to rest.</p>

<p>The situation was a picturesque one not devoid of a
certain solemnity. The light breeze hummed through
the pines overhead, with a pleasant dreamy sound; before
us lay a field of oats, waving and undulating in alternate
light and shade as the soft breath of the summer wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
passed over it; far off on the right the distant spires of
Petersburg showed faint and indistinct through the soft
blue haze; on our left a cloud of dark, black smoke
curled lazily up over the tree tops, and dropped gently
away to leeward from where a large cotton factory had
been fired by the rebels in their retreat. The air was
alive with the hum of insects and the chirp of birds, and
in the trees, on the left of our regiment, a mocking bird
was whistling, softly but clearly. It was a strange
scene, the long lines of faces, the subdued murmur of
conversation, broken only by an occasional shot from the
skirmish line, sounding strangely distant and unreal,
and the flickering shadow of the pine boughs falling at
times on some sunburnt face, with a grave fixed look on
it, which showed how the thoughts were then traveling
back over hundreds of miles to some spot in the far-off
North where the loved ones lay, little conscious of the
fate of their nearest and dearest.</p>

<p>On many faces there a darker shadow than that of the
pine boughs was soon to fall forever, and a brighter and
more lasting glory than that of the sun's rays, as the
swaying boughs moved aside and let in the gleaming light.
For many there, their last sun had arisen, and the fitful
slumber that now from time to time drooped their eyelids
was but the prelude to the "sleep that knows no waking."</p>

<p>But our thoughts were soon recalled to the realities
of the occasion by the order to advance, and under a
sharp fire of cannon and musketry we pressed on across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the oat-field towards a line of works just discernible, ahead
of us. On we went, steadily and unwaveringly, halting
only once to reform the line which had become somewhat
broken from the uneven nature of the ground over which
we were advancing. Forward! again with a cheer, and
we see their skirmishers falling back on their main line
of battle; forward a few steps more, and a wide trench
unexpectedly opens before us&mdash;it is a deep cut on the Norfolk
and Petersburg railroad. A momentary pause as we
catch in a telegraph wire cunningly stretched on stakes
and hid in the long rank grass on the edge of the cut,
and a withering volley sweeps the top of the cut, and numbers
roll down its steep sides to find a grave in the muddy
ditches on the side of the track. Up the steep bank,
on the opposite side, the fragments of our brigade try,
once more, to charge, but the fire that meets them is too
heavy, and they fall back under the protection of the sides
of the cut.</p>

<p>Twice again they attempt it, and twice again they are
compelled to fall back, leaving many of their number behind
on each successive charge. And now, on our right,
the enemy's sharpshooters have got into position and,
firing along the whole length of the cut, pick off a man
at every shot. Capt. Stevens, of Co. A, is mortally
wounded, and 2d Lieut. Lowber, of the same company,
receives a ball through his fore-arm, thus leaving that
company without an officer. And now the enemy are
seen getting a battery into position on a height commanding
the whole of our position. None of our artillery has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
yet come up to support us, and our position if not a critical,
is at least, a most anxious one. But soon the sharp
crack of a Napoleon is heard in our rear and the solid
shot hums along over our heads and sends up a cloud of
dust and splinters as it strikes where the rebels are trying
to build an earthwork, and Capt. Romer, of the 34th
N. Y., has got his guns into position, and with a few well
directed shots, shells the rebels away from their covert.
The crack of those Napoleons was a thoroughly welcome
sound to us all, for it gave evidence that we were not all
alone nor without backers, which, as the troops on our
right and left did not connect with us, appeared at one
time to be the case.</p>

<p>And so the 18th of June, a day memorable in the history
of battles, as the anniversary of Waterloo and
Bunker Hill, wore to a close, and as the welcome shades
of night drew in around us, fresh troops taking our place,
we fell back to the woods we had left in the morning,
with sadly diminished numbers, thoroughly wearied and
exhausted.</p>

<p>Our loss in this day's battle, though not so severe as
in the charge of the preceding day was, nevertheless,
very heavy in proportion to the number of men engaged.
In company A, Capt. Stevens was mortally, and 2d Lieut.
D. A. Lowber, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'severely wouuded'">severely wounded</ins>, and company B lost its
2d Lieut. N. S. Davison, shot through the shoulder. Our
total loss in killed and wounded was 103, of which number
20 were killed on the field or died of wounds, and 83
wounded, making with the casualties of yesterday, an aggre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>gate
of 64 killed and 186 wounded. Total loss 250 out
of 400.</p>

<p>We remained in the position to which we retired on the
night of the 18th June, till the evening of the 20th of
the same month, when we again occupied the front line of
works to the right of our previous position on an eminence
known as Hare Hill, so called from the owner of
the plantation on which it is situated, and which was
afterwards chosen as the site for Fort Steadman.</p>

<p>We remained here till the morning of the 22d, when
we returned to our old position, on the Norfolk and Petersburg
R. R., where we remained doing picket and fatigue
duty, exposed day and night to a heavy fire of
artillery and musketry, till the 10th of July. On the 28th
of June, Lieut. David Prutsman, of company D, was killed
by one of the enemy's sharpshooters while sitting at breakfast,
in the trenches, and our losses in all up to this period
amounted to 286 rank and file. In addition to this
the extreme heat of the weather and the confinement to
which they were subjected in the trenches, had caused our
previously well thinned ranks to be reduced still lower by
sickness. The position of the regiment, all through the
hot summer months was, indeed, anything but enjoyable,
lying on the dusty, sandy ground, exposed to the full
power of the sun's rays by day and the damp chilly dews
by night; obliged to remain in a recumbent position,
where to raise a cap above the breastwork was to make
it the target for half a dozen sharpshooters; water, even
for drinking purposes, hard to get and poor at that, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
that when on the 10th of July we were ordered to the
rear, it was hailed by all as a respite from prison.</p>

<p>After a week's rest, during which, for fear I suppose
that the men might get lazy for want of work, they were
kept busy cutting and carrying material for abattis, the
37th was, on the 17th July, again ordered into the trenches,
where they remained till the morning of the 30th of
July, the day of the battle of Cemetery Hill, or as it is
generally called the "Mine Fort."</p>

<p>This Fort, which was one of the strongest of the enemy's
works, was situated on a hill a little to the right,
and in front of our position, immediately in front of the
cemetery at Blandford, one of the suburbs of Petersburg.
A mine had been driven under the direction of Colonel
Pleasant of the 48th Penn. Vol. Inf., from the rear of
the Horse-shoe, where our regiment lay, under this fort,
had been charged and primed, and was to be exploded
at daylight on the morning of the 30th. Immediately
on the explosion of the mine, the 9th corps was
to advance on the crater and, taking advantage of the
confusion and consternation excited, endeavor to break
and hold the enemy's line. On eminences to the right
and left of Cemetery Hill were forts which commanded it,
and from which a severe enfilading fire could be directed
on the fort itself, and an error in the plan of attack seems
to have been the neglect of having a force ready to attack
and, if possible, capture these works simultaneously
with the assault on the main work, for, had they been
captured or their fire silenced, there is no doubt but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
a permanent lodgment would have been effected in the
main line of the defences of Petersburg.</p>

<p>From the report of the Committee on the Conduct of
the War, the blame of the failure of the whole plan, in
consequence of this blunder, seems to be attributed to
General Meade, and it would certainly seem to be an act
of negligence on his part, with the force he had at his
disposal, to leave these important points unmolested.</p>

<p>The original arrangement had been to explode the mine
at half past four A. M., and for the assaulting column to
advance immediately, but, owing to a fault in the fuse, it
was nearly 6 o'clock before the explosion took place. At
that time a vast column of smoke mingled with earth,
fragments of guns and platforms, logs, sand-bags, gabions
and human beings shot towering into the air to an
immense height, gradually subsiding again and followed
immediately by a dull, smothered roar which shook the
ground for miles round, and was said to have been felt
even to City Point. A pause, in which one might count,
perhaps a dozen beats at the wrist, and 85 pieces of heavy
artillery opened almost simultaneously on the rebel lines.
The enemy was not slow in replying, and soon the light
artillery and musketry chimed in, making the noise completely
deafening, and the very ground under our feet to
vibrate. From 6 till 12 this hellish uproar continued
unabated at which time it commenced to slacken, till, by
four o'clock, it died away, and, as the last of our troops
fell back from the crater, the battle of July 30th was at
an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>On the explosion of the mine, the rebels fled from their
works on each side of it, panic stricken, but, owing to
some unaccountable blunder, this panic was not taken advantage
of, as it might, and should have been, and the
word to advance not being given, for some minutes, time
was given the rebels to recover from the consternation
into which the explosion, thoroughly unlooked for by
them, had thrown them.</p>

<p>The word was given, at last; the charge was made, and
the crater of the exploded mine occupied by our troops
at an inconsiderable loss. Col. Harriman, assisted by
Adjutant C. I. Miltimore and men from different regiments,
succeeded in extricating two of the rebel guns
from the ruins of the fort, and turning them against their
late possessors.</p>

<p>The rebels had, by this time, however, recovered from
their first panic, which had led them to hastily and precipitately
abandon the works on each side the fort, and were
forming in line of battle for the purpose of recapturing
the ruins of the works, and, to cover the attack, were
pouring in a tremendous enfilading fire from the two forts
on the right and left. Reinforcements were sent into
the crater from time to time, but no orders being given
for an attack on either of the flanking works, the crater
had, by this time, become densely packed with troops,
and the explosion having completely leveled the parapet,
they were left almost entirely without protection, and
the whole place soon become a perfect slaughter house.
The position was held, however, till about 4 o'clock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the afternoon, when, the rebels having advanced near
enough to plant their colors on the outside of the works,
and our men being unable to accomplish anything or to
hold the works without immense loss of life, orders were
given for them to fall back to our main line, which was
accordingly done.</p>

<p>In this engagement, out of two hundred and fifty men
who went into action in the morning, only 95 remained to
answer their names at roll-call that evening. Capt. A.
A. Burnett, of company K, received a wound in the head,
from the effects of which he died on the 18th of August;
Capt. Frank A. Cole, received a severe wound in the
hip, which necessitated an operation which proved fatal;
Lieuts. Atwell, G; L. U. Beal, E, and George D. McDill,
K, also received wounds which incapacitated them
from further service, and Lieuts. Munger, D, and Holmes,
G, were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>On the evening of the battle, the regiment was relieved
from the front line and allowed to withdraw to the rear,
where it remained, doing fatigue duty, till the 19th of
August.</p>

<p>On the night of the 19th, the whole regiment was
sent out on fatigue, the work in which they were engaged
being the erection of a large fort, afterwards
named Fort Schenckl, on the Jerusalem Plankroad.</p>

<p>On returning to camp at daylight, next morning, orders
were found awaiting us, "to strike tents and get
ready to march at once." This was no very welcome order
for men who had been hard at work all night, part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the time exposed to a rather brisk artillery fire; but
there was no help for it, the rest of the brigade had already
started, and so after a hasty cup of coffee and a half
hour's nap we started out to overtake the command. After
a long and tedious march through rain and mud, made
at a rapid rate, we caught up with the remainder of the
brigade, which had moved out before daylight, near the
Yellow Tavern, and after a short rest were ordered into
action to repel an attack of the enemy on our front line.
The rebels fell back as we advanced, being driven by us
through the woods, till, gaining an open place and receiving
reinforcements, they once more made a stand, and the
37th was ordered to take up a new position further to the
left, which they did, and held the same till dark, having
lost ten killed and wounded during the battle. During
the night of the 19th and throughout the whole of the
20th, the regiment was moved, from point to point, as
the enemy massed his troops in different positions, in attempting
to regain possession of the Weldon road.</p>

<p>At an early hour on the 21st of August, the regiment
was set to work building a line of entrenchments across
the Weldon railroad, facing towards the rear of our main
line of works. The works were hardly completed before
a determined and combined attack was made by the enemy
on three different points, simultaneously, for the purpose
of regaining possession of the railroad. The 37th
was ordered up to support the 19th New York battery,
which was in position on the extreme left of our line, and
which was suffering severely from the effects of a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and well directed fire which was being directed against
them from a rebel battery in their rear and to the left.
In performing this duty the 37th suffered severely, losing
10 killed and 25 wounded, but succeeding in finally compelling
the enemy to withdraw his guns.</p>

<p>Till the 25th the men wore kept hard at work doing
picket and guard duty, and building breastworks and fortifications
commanding the Weldon railroad and its approaches.
On that day, however, we were once more ordered
to march, our destination being Reams' Station,
where the 2d Corps was engaged and in need of support.
On approaching the scene of action we soon found strong
presumptive evidence of the truth of this position, the
road, for several miles, being thickly lined with stragglers
wearing the clover leaf, the distinguishing badge
of the 2d Corps, and showing that an active retrograde
move was in progression. A part of our brigade was
kept to do provost guard duty and stop and re-assemble
the stragglers as best they might, while the rest, including
the 37th, pushed on and covered the retreat of the
2d Corps, holding the enemy in check till dark, when we
fell back within our lines and slept on our arms that
night.</p>

<p>On the 27th a new line of works was constructed and
a new camp formed near Blick Station, where the time
was passed till the 24th of September in guard and picket
duty. On the 29th the regiment moved to the neighborhood
of the Yellow Tavern, where Colonel Harriman
assumed command of the brigade, now 1st Brig. 1st Div.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
9th A. C., and Major Kershaw, who had partially recovered
from the effects of the wounds he received on the
17th of June, and had rejoined the regiment, took command
of the same. The brigade marched to the neighborhood
of Poplar Grove Church where it was formed as
reserve to the second brigade, which was <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'about assault to'">about to assault</ins>
the enemy's works defending the South Side Railroad
and which were distant about a mile and a half.</p>

<p>In the charge, the 2d brigade was repulsed and, retiring
in disorder, threw part of the 1st brigade into confusion;
a battery also which had been sent up to check the advance
of the enemy, retreated rapidly to the rear, as the
enemy advanced from out of the wood, thus materially
adding to the confusion. The 37th fell back to where
the temporary shelter of a fence enabled them to reform
their line of battle, and by a heavy and well sustained
fire, repulsed several attacks of the enemy, and held the
position till reinforcements arrived and the imminent defeat
was thus rendered a victory. The same night the
regiment went into camp on the Pegram farm where they
constructed a heavy line of works strongly protected by
forts and a line of abattis. The losses of the regiment in
this successive series of battles amounted in all to 25
killed and 75 wounded, and gained it a reputation which it
has maintained untarnished to the end. We remained in
camp on the Pegram farm and in that vicinity, occupied
in picket and fatigue duty till the 28th of October, when
we took part in the reconnaissance in force made in the
direction of Thatcher's Run. Our loss in this affair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
very trifling, only two men being wounded, one very
slightly. We advanced about three miles, meeting little
or no opposition, and having entrenched and remained one
night in the immediate presence of the enemy, we fell
back to our former position on the morning of the 29th.
During this movement Adjt. C. T. Miltimore was wounded
whilst on the picket line.</p>

<p>In the latter part of November, the 9th corps was
moved from the extreme left to the extreme right of the
Army of the Potomac, its left resting on the Weldon R.
R. and its right on the Appomattox; this brought the 1st
Brigade back to their old station in front of the Mine or
Crater Fort, with the 37th Wis. and 109th N. Y. in reserve
in the woods, in the rear of the main line.</p>

<p>Our time here was fully occupied in building houses for
the winter, standing picket, doing guard and fatigue duty
more or less exposed to the enemy's fire, day and night.</p>

<p>On the 8th of December the 37th, in company with
the 109th N. Y. were ordered to move to the rear and
report to Brevet Col. Robinson, commanding Provisional
Brigade. We moved out soon after dark on a bitter cold
night, a cutting north-east wind sweeping over the bare
surface of the country with a chill that went to the marrow.
All that night and the next day and night, when
a mingled storm of rain and snow set in, as if to cap the
climax and add what little was wanting, of making our
situation as uncomfortable as possible, we remained on a
bare open common, without any tents, a good many without
blankets, and with nothing at hand with which to
build a fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sanitary Commission, with its well-known generosity,
sent down a pair of woolen mittens and a cup of
hot milk punch for each man in the brigade, on the evening
of the second day, which added materially to our
comfort and rendered our situation somewhat more endurable.</p>

<p>At length, at about 3 o'clock of the afternoon of the
third day, the orders came to march. It was drawing towards
the close of a dull, raw winter's day as our men,
stiff and cold with exposure and want of rest, started
wearily off down the Jerusalem Plank Road. The road
was almost knee deep in half frozen mud and sleet, the
broken planks lay round in every direction, and as we
blundered on through the darkness that, accompanied by
a drizzling rain, soon fell on us, many "a curse not loud
but deep" was vented on Virginia, her roads and her
rebels. Once, and once only did we rest that night, and
daylight, or as much of it as could struggle through a
dull, leaden looking sky, found us at the end of our
march, at Hawkin's Tavern, on the Nottoway River, the
scene of the defeat of Kautz and Wilson in their raid
during the summer of '63. And here, for the first time,
we learned the nature and object of our expedition.</p>

<p>The second and fifth corps had started off on a raid
along the line of the Weldon R. R. which they had struck
at Jarrett's Station, and had torn up and destroyed the
track from that point to the North Carolina line, burning
the bridge over the Meherrin River, and pushing on, almost
to Weldon. Our mission was to reinforce them and
protect their rear, on the homeward march, if the dispo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>sition
of the enemy's force should seem to menace their
safety, and we were ordered to wait at Hawkin's till their
rear had passed.</p>

<p>About 3 o'clock the Second Corps passed through our
camp and immediately afterwards the Provisional Brigade
was put in motion and followed them at a rapid rate.
About two miles from Hawkin's we passed through the
midst of the 2d corps, camped on each side the road, but
no orders were given us to halt and our command was
pushed on, without a halt and without a rest, until the
thirty miles between us and camp were accomplished.
This was the severest marching we ever undertook, the
distance being accomplished in about seven hours by men
in heavy marching order, carrying sixty rounds ammunition
and four days rations, besides their knapsacks and
accoutrements, and chilled and stiffened by exposure to
three days and nights very inclement weather. On our
return, in retaliation for the murder of two of its number
by citizens of Sussex county, the 2d corps fired every
house and building along the line of march, from the
Nottoway river to our rear line of works, in front of
Petersburg, drove off large numbers of oxen, sheep, pigs,
horses, mules, &amp;c., and brought in with them a large
number of negroes.</p>

<p>After our return to the inside of our lines in front of
Petersburg, we remained for two days in a temporary
camp, in rear of the Jones House, after which we returned
to our old camp on the Baxter Road, where we
remained in winter quarters till the opening of the campaign
of '65.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="small">THE CAMPAIGN OF 1865</span>.</h2>


<p>Never, since the first gun was fired at Sumter, had the
prospects of the Union cause appeared to be so nearly
approximating a triumphant result, as at the commencement
of the year 1865. While the rebels were daily, and
almost hourly, losing all hope and confidence of success,
while, one after another, their avenues of supplies and
munitions of war were being closed to them, while their
men, losing all faith in the promises of their leaders, were
deserting daily by hundreds, and while their legislative
assemblies were becoming disorderly, and disorganized
meetings where personal abuse and mutual recriminations
had long since taken the place of orderly and proper debate,&mdash;even
the most faint-hearted of those who had the
interests of the nation at heart, had begun to take courage,
and to see the dawn of a brighter day at length approaching.
Sherman had made his triumphant "march
to the sea;" Fort Fisher had been captured and the
Cape Fear River, one of the principal blockade running
ports, had thus been effectually closed; Charleston was
soon to fall and Sumter once more bore the old flag aloft.</p>

<p>The rebel press, though arrogant and blatant to the
last, in its gross perversion of facts and its earnest endeavors
to convert any disaster to the Union arms, however
trifling, into a great Confederate victory, gave evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
tokens, of a conviction, gradually growing in force and
spreading far and wide through the South, that the frustration
of their schemes was at hand, that secession was
a failure and its days numbered. The Richmond <cite>Whig</cite>,
Petersburg <cite>Express</cite>, and various other papers, tools of
the rebel government, in a series of articles, plausibly
and cleverly written and well calculated to deceive the
unlettered masses of the South, claimed for the South a
better condition, than they had known since the commencement
of the war. Their army was reported by
them to be well fed, clothed and sheltered, the spirits and
courage of the men to be excellent and a certain and sure
triumph of the Confederate cause, was prophecied as
about to be the result of the commencement of hostilities,
in which Lee would take the initiative in the spring.</p>

<p>On our side of the lines in front of Petersburg, however,
a contrary impression prevailed, and as the winter
wore away, even the most despondent began to cheer up
as the hollowness of the Confederacy became apparent,
the most obtuse could see that the beginning of the end
was approaching, and all were looking forward to a speedy
crushing out and final extinction of the last spark of rebellion.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole of the long dreary winter, night
after night, shivering and half famished, miserably
clothed, worse fed, and wretchedly armed, the rebel pickets
had deserted their posts and came into our lines, all
telling the same tale of suffering, deprivation and disaffection.
Sometimes singly, sometimes in squads of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
or four, or even greater numbers, they preferred running
their chances of being shot, by our men or their own, to
lingering on, suffering from cold and hunger, with an
equal chance of being eventually either shot or hung.
The Army of the Potomac, on the other hand, which had
been comfortably hutted and furnished with the best of
food and clothing, through the winter, had received a
large accession to its numbers, both in recruits and also
in convalescents from the different hospitals; our leisure
hours had been passed in resting from the severe campaign
of the preceding year, with drilling enough to give us
exercise, keep us in health, and to render us more efficient
as soldiers. The numerous desertions from the
rebels and the many successive Union victories had instilled
confidence in the minds of our men, just in proportion
as it had dispirited and demoralized the rebels, all
felt sure of victory, and that the end was at hand.</p>

<p>The commencement of the year found the 37th in winter
quarters on the Baxter road, just in front of their
old battle field of the 17th of June, and in rear of Fort
Morton. Considerable addition had been made to our
numbers during the winter; a large majority had had an
opportunity of visiting their homes and friends; our casualties
had been few and the health and spirits of the
entire regiment were excellent. With increasing satisfaction,
as each day's mail brought tidings of further Union
successes, we watched the net closing tighter and closer
around rebeldom and began to look forward toward the
prospect of a speedy return to our homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>As the severer rigors of winter passed off, and the
mild, warm days of an early spring began to awaken the
vegetable world from its long sleep, the enemy, who had
for some months, been remarkably quiet and civil, commenced
annoying us by assailing us with mortar and
Parrott shells whenever we attempted to indulge in a
brigade drill or dress parade. These exhibitions of animosity,
however, beyond driving a few timid natures to
the doubtful security of pine trees and stumps, soon
ceased to create much excitement and served mainly as
an excellent preparation to accustom the ears of our new
recruits to the sound of these missiles. Nobody ever got
hurt by them, and nobody cared much for them. In the
month of March we were visited by several severe tornadoes
which threw down a number of the trees, among
which our camp was built, and, on one occasion, killed
one man, Corporal Kenneday of company F.</p>

<p>And so the time wore on, till at length an order came
"one fine day" for all Sutlers to go to the base at City
Point, for officers and men to turn in all their superfluous
winter clothing, and for all arms and ammunition to be
thoroughly inspected. The Army of the Potomac was
stripping for the fight. Again a few days and rumors,
undefined and indistinct at first, but gaining plausibility
as time passed on, began to circulate through our camps
that "Sheridan had come." And sure enough, one fine
summer-like spring morning, three or four wild, rough-looking
individuals mounted on lean, but tough wiry
animals, rode into our camp, clothed in Confederate uni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>form,
and on being seized and questioned, declared themselves,
not without a certain pride in so doing, to be
"scouts in the service of General Sheridan." In confirmation,
they pointed to a long line of dust, in rear of
our camp, where, with the aid of our field glasses, we
could dimly discern a large column of cavalry filing slowly
along towards the left, in full view of the enemy and
within range of his guns, proudly, defiantly, as if the
mere fact of their being Sheridan's men, were a safeguard
in itself.</p>

<p>This looked like business, and we prepared ourselves
accordingly, remaining for the next three weeks in a continued
state of excitement and expectation. On one occasion
we thought the fun had commenced, a succession
of loud cheers, or rather yells, accompanied by rapid and
continued firing from the picket line on our left, leading
us to suppose that Gen. Lee had opened the ball by taking
the initiative himself, and was about to try the
strength of our position. We were quickly under arms,
and drawn up in line of battle, in the rear of Fort Morton,
ready to move, wherever fate and the commanding
general might choose to send us. Having waited there
for an hour or two, and the disturbance, which turned out
to be nothing more than a mere picket <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">emeute</i>, having
gradually quieted down, we were permitted to return in
peace to our camp.</p>

<p>But more stirring scenes in the drama were at hand,
time was rolling along, and the 25th of March and 2d of
April were approaching. The rebellion, which the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sanguine of us never expected to end before July, was
even then tottering to its fall, and a few weeks more were
to see its final overthrow.</p>

<p>Ever since the nocturnal picket skirmish, I have mentioned
above, the general commanding the division had
impressed on us the necessity of exercising an extra
amount of vigilance and caution; trench guards were
doubled, the constant supervision of the picket line and
reports as to the vigilance and efficiency of officers and
men on duty there, were rendered an imperative part of
the duties of the brigade officer of the day; brigade and
regimental commanders exercised, in most cases, a sleepless
and cat-like supervision of everything that occurred
within the rebel lines, within their scope of observation;
the signal man on the Avery House waved his flags and
lanterns, frantically, day and night; our days were spent
with field glasses and telescopes stuck to our eyes as if
they grew there, and our night's rest was broken by orders
sent round three or four times a night exacting the
observance of the greatest vigilance or demanding information
as to the movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>Our position became like that of "Sister Ann" in
Bluebeard's tower and the part of Fatima, was, as the
play bills say, "ably sustained" by our commanding generals,
in their perpetual demands, as to whether "We
saw anybody coming?"</p>

<p>On the morning of the 25th of March we were aroused
from such restless sleep as we were in the habit of taking
in those days, by the sound of three shots fired in rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
succession from the rebel lines, and quickly followed by
a scattering fire of musketry. A very few minutes
sufficed for the donning of arms and accoutrements, and
in less time than it takes to read this page, we were under
arms and awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Meantime the batteries on either side had opened and
were keeping up a very lively interchange of missiles;
close on our right the second brigade was evidently
warmly engaged, as a lively musketry fire, enlivened once
in a while with the report of a heavy gun, testified. The
morning was dull and cloudy and nothing had yet occurred
to enable us to form any conclusion as to what was
on hand, but, after a few minutes we were ordered down
to the right of the brigade and drawn up on the flank, at
right angles to the main line of works, and here we began
to gather an inkling of the facts of the case.</p>

<p>Right in our front, on an eminence on the opposite
side of a ravine, on one side of which we lay <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'snugly ensconsed'">snugly ensconced</ins>
behind a light line of works, was Fort Steadman,
a large and very strong work built on Hare Hill, the spot
where we had encamped nearly a year ago, just after the
battle of the 18th of June. In and around this a fierce
fight was going on, and to the rear of it were to be seen
flashes, indicating that sharp skirmishing was going on in
the direction of Meade Station, The truth was at once
apparent. Massing his forces under cover of the night
and taking advantage of the darkness of the morning
and the close proximity of our lines, the enemy had
driven in our picket line, surprised the garrison of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fort and captured it, and was now pushing for the City
Point Railroad, and, perhaps, City Point itself, in fact
<em>our lines were broken</em>.</p>

<p>By the time we had arrived at this conclusion, which
was anything but a pleasant one, the firing in our rear
had increased considerably, and daylight having at length
fairly asserted its supremacy, we could see the rebel troops
falling rapidly back into Fort Steadman. It had also
become sufficiently light for our artillery to get the range
and open on the fort, which they were now doing with
a will, making their pieces speak with vigor and much to
the purpose. This fact the rebels seemed fully to appreciate
and regulated the duration of their second visit to
the fort to a merely <em>passing</em> one, passing right through
and over the parapet on the other side, back to their own
lines as fast as possible. The cause of their retreat was
soon apparent. Just as they commenced leaving, the third
division of the 9th corps, under Brevet Major General
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Hartranit'">Hartranft</ins>, appeared coming up over the edge of the ravine,
advancing in line of battle in excellent order, and
with the General at their head leading the charge. On
they go, unbroken and unwavering, leaving here and there
a man on the field, but never stopping or faltering. The
"Johnnies" don't like the look of things, they evidently
think they are in a tight place, "and have waked up the
wrong passenger." And so they take their leave, <em>piling</em>
over the parapets and swarming back to their lines like
bees from a hive, leaving behind them hundreds of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
dead and wounded, ten battle flags and any quantity of
arms and accoutrements. A great number prefer taking
their chances of a Union prison to facing Union bullets,
and throwing away their arms, sneak in under cover of
our breastworks and surrender themselves as prisoners of
war. Meanwhile the 3d division has occupied Fort Steadman,
the firing has ceased and the 37th goes home to
breakfast, having for the first and only time been disengaged
spectators of a battle.</p>

<p>The regiment suffered no loss in this affair, as although
exposed to some shelling, it was not directly engaged with
any portion of the enemy's forces, remaining on the field
solely for the purpose of covering the right flank and
rear of the 1st brigade.</p>

<p>The next week was passed in an uneasy, ominous state
of comparative quiet, the lull that always precedes a
storm of any kind whatever, broken by occasional rumors
and reports, and sundry turnings out at unseasonable
hours of the day and night. At length, on the evening
of Saturday, the 1st of April, our chief, suspecting
that Lee was about to evacuate, directed our batteries to
feel the enemy's line, so as to find out, if possible, whether
he had withdrawn his artillery or not. About half
past ten the performance commenced, and the 37th was
ordered to fall in, as usual, and move down to the support
of our picket line.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had moved out of camp, the enemy
began replying with his mortars, showing that these, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
least, had not been removed, and, from their fire, one of
our men was wounded as we marched down the new covered
way leading to our picket line. We soon got into
position in a deep valley or ravine, just in the rear of our
picket line, and there, for about three hours, were witnesses
of one of the most sublime and terrific spectacles
of the war. Every gun and every mortar along the
whole length of the two opposing lines was, by this time,
fairly in action, and the various missiles, plainly to be
traced in their course through the air, by the train of
sparks from the burning fuse, were crossing one another
at every angle and in every direction. Watching this
grand pyrotechnic display from a secure and tolerably
comfortable position, time passed rapidly enough, till
about half past twelve, on the morning of Sunday, the
2d of April, when, the firing having gradually died away,
we were ordered to march out by the left flank and report
at Brigade Headquarters.</p>

<p>Arriving here, we were quickly joined by the 8th and
27th Michigan, 38th Wisconsin, and 109th New York,
the 51st Pennsylvania, with a company from each of the
other regiments, being left to take care of the picket line
on our brigade front. After a short delay, we moved
rapidly off towards the left, and about an hour before
daylight were formed in line of battle in Fort Sedgwick,
or, as it is better known, "Fort Hell," the business that
brought us there being to support a charge that our 3d
Division was about to make on Fort Mahone, otherwise
known as "Fort Damnation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>These works bore the reputation of being the strongest
and most formidable on the two lines, and it was
with rather dubious feelings that we waited for the signal
to advance, and the words of Brutus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verse6">&mdash;"Oh that a man might know</p>
<p class="verse">The end of this day's business, e're it come!</p>
<p class="verse">But it sufficeth, that the day will end,</p>
<p class="verse">And the end is known."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">occurred to many of us, probably more than once,
through the course of the eventful day that was just beginning
to dawn. At last the order is given, and silently
and rapidly, just as the first grey streaks of dawn begin
to shine in the east, we see the dusky forms file out past
us into the open field beyond the fort. Then our turn
comes next, and away we go with orders to keep as far
to the left as we can get. On we go, grape, canister
and case shot whistling round us in every direction, over
a cornfield with the dried stalks still standing&mdash;over our
picket line&mdash;across a small marshy run&mdash;"this must be
the rebel picket line!" "hullo, there's a dead Johnny!"
and in another minute we have retaliated on the rebels
for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'their attrck'">their attack</ins> of the 25th of March, and Fort Mahone
and two or three hundred yards of the rebel works are in
possession of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the 9th
Army Corps.</p>

<p>At daylight, we discover that during the darkness and
confusion, two companies of our regiment have separated
somewhat from the rest, and are lying in Fort Mahone,
while the remainder of the regiment lie a little to the
right of that work. We hold our position all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that day, while fighting is going on on each side of us,
from the Appomattox to the extreme left, and away
round to the Five-forks, where Wright and Sheridan are
busy at work. But we have no time to think of what is
going on, on either side of us, events in our own neighborhood
demand all our attention. Several times, in the
course of the day, the rebels attempt to regain the fort,
and as often we send them back till the hillside in our
front is thick with dead and dying.</p>

<p>And so the 2d of April draws to a close, the rebel line
is broken and the city of Petersburg is, virtually, ours.
All that night we pass, under arms, in the rebel works,
and at daylight on the 3d, advance in line of battle, not
a shot from the enemy to check our progress&mdash;we can see
the cannon remaining in several of the forts, but where
are the gunners?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="verseq">"Did traitors lurk in the <em>rebel</em> hold?</p>
<p class="verse">Had their hands grown stiff or their hearts grown cold?</p>

<p class="verse">There flashed no fire, there hissed no ball."</p>
<p class="right">&mdash;<cite>Siege of Corinth.</cite></p>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noindent">and now we are up to the second line of works, they are
silent and empty, and Gen. Hartranft, commanding the
3d Division of our Corps, jumps astride of the 8-inch
Columbiad, which, a week or two before, had shelled his
headquarters in the Avery House, and which he had
sworn he would "straddle."</p>

<p>And now the fact becomes evident, <em>Petersburg is
evacuated</em>. We break from line of battle into column,
and dipping down into a ravine we see, as we mount the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
hill on the other side, the cockade city lying stretched
out at our feet, the goal we have been striving for, for
almost a year, is won, and Petersburg is ours.</p>

<p>It seems strange and dream-like, at first, to stand
there and look down, at close quarters, on the spires and
cupolas that for many a long month we have watched
from a distance, and to trace their connections, with the
buildings of which they formed a part, in reality, instead
of only in imagination, as before.</p>

<p>Yes, there it lay before us looking, somehow, strangely
civilized and peaceful with its old fashioned steep-roofed
houses nestled down amongst the trees, the smoke from
the chimneys curling upwards into the bright blue sky
overhead&mdash;a crowd of darkies "Hurrahing and Hallelujahing"
around us, accompanying their expressions of
delight with a grotesque exhibition of antics and grimaces,
and "<em>Bressing</em> de Lord and the Yankees," about
alike, for the freedom that had this day come to them.
And now as the light gets stronger, we see the colors of
the 2d Michigan waving from the Court House, and the
strains of a brass band come floating down the wind faint
and indistinct in the distance. But a note here and
there is sufficient to show that it is a salute to the flag
that waves over the captured city, and, as the well-known
strains of the "Star Spangled Banner" fall clearer and
clearer on the ear, our own flags are "unfurled to the
glad breeze of heaven," and a cheer goes up to greet
them, that awakens the echoes of the city far and wide.</p>

<p>We sit down under the shade of the locust trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
discuss a hasty breakfast, when the word is given, "Fall
in," and we march back to camp, to bid farewell to the
spot that, for nearly six months, has been our only home,
to pack up our Lares and Penates and transporting them,
like Ulysses, (not Grant, but him of Troy) on our back,
start off in pursuit of the rebel army, or wherever it may
please Grant to send us.</p>

<p>The same evening the brigade was moved out on to the
Boydton Plankroad where the men were allowed a brief
rest after a week of duty, which had pretty well tired us
all out, both officers and men. It is true that we had
had little or no marching, and only one day's fighting,
but the continual state of tension in which our nerves
were kept all that time, and the want of rest, made us
all glad of a respite from our labors.</p>

<p>We remained camped near the city till the 6th of the
month, Col. Ely, commanding 2d brigade, 1st division,
9th army corps, being appointed Military Governor of
the same, Brevet Major General Wilcox, commanding
the district. We found the inhabitants, for the most
part, orderly and well disposed, though a few cases of
outrage towards our troops occurred which were as much
deprecated and resented by the more orderly and well behaved
portion of the community, as by us.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Petersburg</span> is a remarkably neat and pretty city, situated
on the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Appomatox'">Appomattox</ins> River, about ten miles above
its confluence with the James at City Point. Before the
war it contained somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty
thousand inhabitants, though at the time of our occupa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>tion
of it, its population scarcely numbered over fifteen
thousand. It was originally a trading post, established
by one Peters, for traffic with the Indians, and in process
of time, and as the country became settled, became a
place of trade for the settlers in the vicinity. The original
town was located about where the cemetery at
Blandford now stands, and for a time, was known as
Peter's, afterwards as Pocahontas, this latter name being
still given to a hamlet across the river, forming a suburb
of the city. The name was finally changed to Petersburg
which it retains to this day; it is situated principally in
Dinwiddie county, and is the principal tobacco shipping
point in the South. The neighboring counties of Prince
George and Pocahontas, have a fertile, highly productive
soil, raising corn, tobacco, sugar-cane and cotton as well
as wheat, barley, oats and other cereals. It has railroad
communications with Richmond, distant twenty-five miles,
Burkesville sixty miles, Weldon, N. C., seventy-five
miles, Norfolk and Suffolk sixty-three miles, and a short
railroad also connects it with City Point, its port of entry,
to which place there is easy access, from the coast,
for vessels drawing fifteen feet of water.</p>

<p>There are several large cotton, flour, and lumber mills
erected on the rapids of the Appomattox, which furnish
an unequalled water power, as yet only partially developed,
and a proper attention paid to which would largely
increase the wealth and importance of the place. The
streets are wide and straight, nicely ornamented with
shade trees, and the public buildings, for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
part, well designed and well finished. In hotels the city
is rather deficient, there being but one decent one, the
Jarrett House, in the whole place. Sycamore street, the
principal business street of the city, contains a few fine
buildings and stores, and quite a number of handsome
residences.</p>

<p>The stores were mostly closed on our arrival, and but
few of them had much of a stock on hand, Confederate
scrip having for a long time been quoted "low" and the
supply scant. On the Saturday preceding the Monday
on which we arrived in the city, flour had been sold at
$1,400 a barrel, wood $50 a cord and other necessaries
of life in proportion. The lower part of the city bore
severe traces of the siege, hardly a house being unmarked
by either shot or shell. The gas works were nearly
torn to pieces, a long chimney, eighty-five feet in height,
which had once formed part of the building, having been
thrown down a short time before our arrival, after having
received thirty-five shells through it in different places.
The clock on the Town Hall had also been perforated by
a three inch shell, though strange to say, the missile had
not damaged the works in the least. Two bridges
across the Appomattox and three large warehouses full of
tobacco, had been set on fire and destroyed by the rebels
when they evacuated. A fine strong bridge leading
across the river, from the South Side railroad depot to
the railway company's machine shop, had been loaded
with two new locomotives and all the cars that could be
placed on it, and then set fire to, cars and locomotives
being thus precipitated into the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>A large quantity of commissary stores, consisting of
corn meal, bacon, coffee, (unroasted,) sugar and tobacco,
was found in the rebel government warehouses and were
afterwards issued to the destitute citizens, irrespective of
color. Captain John Cooper, of the 5th Wisconsin, was
appointed C. S., and the scene in his office, from daylight
till dark, was a novel one.</p>

<p>Ladies of the first family type, clothed in deepest black,
with a sullen, defiant look on their handsome faces, sometimes
closely veiled; Africa, of all shades, from the genuine
sable "mungo," with skin like polished ebony, and
showing from between his extended gums a formidable
array of ivory, to the graceful quadroon, hardly a shade
darker, and very often a great deal handsomer than her
late mistress, standing within a few feet of one another,
all jubilant and triumphant, all rejoicing in their new
found freedom, kind and polite to the boys in blue, their
liberators, and obsequious, to a degree, to shoulder straps.
Poor things, what their future may be, we know not, but
they can never know a happier day in their lives, than
when, there on the third of April, 1865, the fetters fell
from their hands, as from Paul and Silas in prison, and
they stood, for the first time in their lives, free men and
women.</p>

<p>On the 6th of April, the 1st division, 9th army corps,
was relieved from duty in Petersburg, and moved out on
the line of the South Side Railroad, having its headquarters
at Burkesville, and the corps being strung along the
road from that place to Petersburg. The 37th moved out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
at daylight and camped about dark near Ford's Station,
from whence they were afterwards removed to beyond
Wellsville and in the neighborhood of Black's and White's,
where they remained till after the surrender of Lee and
Johnston and their armies, guarding the railroad and the
farms and plantations adjoining, and administering, as
far as our commissariat would permit, to the wants of
the adjacent population.</p>

<p>Overrun and devastated by two contending armies, the
once rich country, surrounding Petersburg and Richmond,
is to-day a wilderness. Not only have the crops been
swept off to supply the wants of the Confederate soldiers,
but the cattle and horses have been also absorbed for the
same purpose. Fences have been torn down and burnt,
houses, sheds and barns stripped of their coverings to
furnish huts for winter quarters, and the whole country
converted into a scene of devastation and ruin. Deserters
from both armies have formed bands of guerrillas for
the purposes of plunder and pillage, men from the opposing
armies having in some cases associated together for
this purpose.</p>

<p>A rather amusing incident of this kind which occurred
whilst we were near Black's and White's, may serve as
an illustration. Col. Harriman, having been informed
that large body of guerrillas had formed a camp in his
neighborhood, sent Capt. Burnett, A. D. C. on his staff,
accompanied by a sufficient force, to reconnoitre and report
on the condition of affairs. The Captain set out on
his expedition and soon arrived in sight of the enemy, (?)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
whom he found to consist of about a couple of hundred
colored individuals camped in due form, and with camp
guards, &amp;c., duly posted. The <em>commanding officer</em> was
a private of the 5th Mass. Colored Cavalry, who had, by
some means or other, strayed from his command, and had,
like David, "gathered to him every one (of his color) that
was in distress and every one that was discontented,"
and had established a camp in regular military style.</p>

<p>The sable chieftain sat at his tent door as the Captain
approached, and while one intelligent son of Africa was
carefully cleaning his master's (?) horse, another highly
intellectual contraband was blacking his boots. The
scene was a rich one and might be taken for the frontispiece
of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe's next novel. The
terms of capitulation were not, we believe, quite as ceremonious
nor so advantageous as those agreed on between
Gens. Grant and Lee, for poor Cuffee was sent back to
his regiment under arrest, and his sable warriors who belonged
to the neighboring plantations dispersed to their
homes, and their arms, which they had collected from the
battle field of the Five Forks, turned over to Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Whilst camped here the sad news reached us of the
brutal assassination of President Lincoln by the wretched
maniac, Booth, and I say maniac, not to palliate his crime,
but because his act was one none but a maniac would
have committed. For, however much he may have sympathized
with the Southern cause and hated its fancied
oppressors, he might have known that such an expression
of malignity and revenge, even though sanctioned by the
Confederate government, as after events have shown it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was, would, as it in fact has, crush out all sympathy for
the rebellion, at home and abroad, and extinguish the
last sentiment of pity for what its partisans have been
pleased to call their heroic resistance against superior
numbers.</p>

<p>The effect the news of the assassination had on the
army may be imagined, but cannot be described. In the
midst of our rejoicings at the successes which had so
lately crowned our efforts, and while the praises and acclamations
of the North were yet ringing in our ears, it
fell on us like a thunderbolt. Just as the dawn of peace,
crowning the long and arduous labors of the past four
years, was beginning to illuminate his pathway, in the
very zenith of his career and at the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'heighth'">height</ins> of his fame,
our good, kind President was ruthlessly and brutally murdered.
There is no need here to eulogize those virtues,
so well known to all who have watched so anxiously and
with such interest the successive acts of his career, nor
to enlarge on that stubborn honesty and integrity of purpose
and principle which has brought this nation safely
through a sea of troubles which well nigh overwhelmed it.
Abraham Lincoln has gone to his account, and the tears
of a nation that honored him whilst living, follow him to
the grave, now that he is dead. The loss is ours, not
his; he has died at his post with his harness on his back;
he has laid down his life for the country he loved more
than life itself, a soldier in the cause of humanity, freedom
and right, and what could man wish more. Peace to
his soul! When the time comes for us to go, may our
record, if not as glorious, be at least as clear as his.</p>

<p>The surrender of Lee and Johnston with their entire
armies, put an end to the rebellion in Virginia, and left
the Army of the Potomac, for the first time in four years,
out of employment, with no one to fight and looking
round for some one to hit or to "tread on the tail of its
coat." Such things could not last, so on the 20th of
April we had orders to pack up and move from our camp
on the South Side railroad to City Point, there to take
transports for Washington. This we accordingly did,
and after a tiresome march, arrived at City Point on the
morning of the 22d.</p>

<p>A few hours sufficed for all necessary arrangements, and
before evening the steamer <i>Daniel Webster</i>, having on
board Col. Harriman and staff, Gen. Humphries of the 2d
corps, and the 37th and 38th Wisconsin, was steaming
slowly down the James river against a strong flood tide.
We passed Harrison's Landing, where the 9th corps crossed
the James on pontoons in its march from Cold Harbor
to Petersburg, during the summer of last year, and just
below this point, the last rays of the setting sun were
shining on the glorious old stars and stripes floating
proudly over Fort Powhattan, the strongest work on the
James river. Our boat having no regular government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
pilot, was compelled to anchor shortly after dark, and
wait till morning and daylight should enable us to pick
our way along the mazy channel. We passed Fortress
Monroe with its "even trench" and frowning embrasures
about sunrise, and steamed out through Hampton Roads,
past that singularly amphibious locality, part fort, part
prison, known as the Rip Raps, into the smooth waters
of Chesapeake Bay. The morning was still and pleasant,
a light breeze from the northwest created just enough
swell to give an easy rise and fall to the vessel, enough
to make us feel that we were at sea, and hardly enough
to unsettle the internal arrangements of the least nautical
of our passengers. Far away on the starboard bow,
Capes Charles and Henry were just visible, faint blue
streaks in the distant offing. Astern of us were Norfolk,
Fortress Monroe, the Rip Raps, several Men of War, including
two British and one French steam frigate, and
several saucy looking Yankee gunboats, bustling round
in a great hurry, making a great swell in the water and a
great noise with their escaping steam, as if they had important
government business on hand and were anxious
to get through with it. Schooners, barques and sloops
of all sizes, builds and styles were either dropping easily
down before the light wind, their big fore-and-aft sails
boomed out on either side and giving them the appearance,
as they rose and fell on the swells, of sea-birds, perched
on the water, with their wings spread ready to take flight,
or with sheets flat aft were working up the bay, passing
and repassing one another as they tacked and tacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
again. And the huge steam frigates lay there quiet, and,
as it seemed, disdainful watchers of the whole scene,
models of order and neatness from truck to deck, every
rope taut and in its place, every spar and every line clear
and distinct against the blue sky behind them, the black
muzzles of the guns with their white tompions all in even
line, and the boats at the swinging boom, each with its
boat-tender aboard to keep it from chafing and rubbing
against its neighbor&mdash;everything orderly, methodical,
neat. (And here a moral. What a pity some people in
this world cannot, like a man-of-war's boat, be furnished
with a boat-tender, to keep the waves of envy and unfriendliness
from causing them to chafe against their fellows.)</p>

<p>But ethics and moralizing have but little to do with
the 1st brigade, 1st division, 9th army corps, and still
less with the good ship <i>Daniel Webster</i>, which, about
this time, was bowling along up the bay, at the rate of
ten knots an hour. About noon we passed the light-ship
on Wolf Trap Shoals, with the <em>tin-clad</em> lying alongside,
to protect her from guerrillas. For, the inference being
but fair that those fiends, who would not hesitate to destroy
a train containing innocent women and children,
would have as little compunction in destroying the often-times
only friend of the storm-beaten ship, in her most
thrilling hours of danger, all the light-houses and light-vessels
along the coast of Virginia are strongly guarded,
day and night. Just before dark, we entered the mouth
of the Potomac, and, in obedience to a hail from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
guard-ship, at Port Washington, made fast to the dock
at Alexandria, at sunrise, on the morning of the 24th.
Here we disembarked, and were marched out to a very
pleasant camping-ground, on the line of the Orange and,
Alexandria railroad. We remained here two days, when
we received orders to march to Washington. Thither we
accordingly went, and the evening of the same day found
us encamped near Tenallytown, between Forts Gaines
and Simmons, and not far from the Chain Bridge. Here
we remained, "possessing our souls in peace," and doing
a little picket duty, a little drilling, not a little dress-parading,
and, in fact, playing soldiers; with nothing to
do, and all day to do it in; and, barring a slight suspicion
of monotony, leading a not unpleasant life.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, May 9th, we had a very pleasant
reunion, at brigade headquarters, the occasion being the
presentation to Col. Harriman, by the officers of his staff,
of a very handsome sword. The presentation was made,
in the name of the staff, by Capt. Charles McCreery, 8th
Michigan Volunteers, Inspector General, who in a very
neat and appropriate speech descanted on the pleasant
nature of the relations that had always existed between
the Colonel and his staff, officially and otherwise, during
the long time he had commanded the brigade, and speaking
in terms of the warmest commendation of the able
and efficient manner in which the Colonel had commanded
the brigade both in camp and in action. The Colonel responded,
briefly and to the purpose, and after an hour or
so spent in social chat the party broke up, pleased and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
gratified at the opportunity that had been afforded them
of showing their appreciation of an able and gallant
officer.</p>

<p>When the last grand pageant of the war passed through
the streets of the capital, and the army, that for the last
four years, had been laboring to maintain the existence of
the country and to uphold its chosen form of government,
received a sincere and hearty public welcome at the hands
of a grateful people. Our regiment took a part in the
pageant and received its share of the welcome. For two
days, Washington was the scene of a military display,
the like of which the world has never seen, and God grant
may never have occasion to see again. From nine in the
morning till three in the afternoon of each day, Pennsylvania
Avenue, from the Capitol to Georgetown, was covered
with troops, as the armies of the Potomac, Tennessee
and Georgia passed along through crowds of their
fellow citizens who had turned out to welcome them
home.</p>

<p>The long wide street, with its shady sidewalks and
handsome buildings, was dressed in its gayest. The
fresh spring verdure of the trees, the glorious stripes and
stars waving everywhere, the bright glancing bayonets,
set off by the dark blue of their bearers, the regimental
colors and guidons, the waving of flags and handkerchiefs
from every window, the lively strains of the various
brigade and regimental bands, the bright clear sky and
sun overhead, formed a sight once seen, never to be forgotten,
and worth ten years of a man's life for him to be
able to say, "I was there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>But the details of this brilliant military panorama are
now history, so suffice it to say that the 37th contributed
their part to the show and received their welcome from
the Washingtonians and their friends.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 25th of May, the 1st brigade
was reviewed by Colonel Harriman and a large party of
distinguished visitors, guests of Colonel H's. The party
included Governor Lewis, Gen. Lucius Fairchild, Gen.
Gaylord, Brev. Brig. Gen. C. Fairchild, Governor Crapo
of Michigan, Major Chas. Hamlin, son of the late Vice
President, and his sister, Mrs. Bachelor, Col. Proudfit of
Wisconsin, Mrs. Gen. Fairchild, and a large delegation
of civilians and soldiers from Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The review was preceded by brigade dress parade, followed
by a short drill, after which the ranks were opened
and Col. Harriman, accompanied by the two Governors,
Gens. Fairchild and Gaylord, rode along the front and
rear of the line, the ranks were then closed and the brigade,
having formed column by company, marched past in
review. Great praise was awarded for the accuracy and
regularity with which the whole affair passed off, by all
present, both civil and military.</p>

<p>At our camp in Tenallytown we remained without any
occurrence of moment coming to break the monotony of
our lives, daily expecting an order to return home, and
daily being disappointed.</p>

<p>The orders mustering out all men sick in hospital and
all whose term of service expired before October 1st,
1865, reduced us much in number, and an effort was made
to consolidate the 38th with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of July an order, directing the consolidation
to take place, was received, but was again
countermanded, in consequence of an order from the War
Department to muster out the whole 9th corps.</p>

<p>Some reason or the other, no doubt a good and sufficient
one, delayed the order, however, for some time on its
passage from the Adjutant General's office in Washington,
causing no little grumbling and a great many <em>curse</em>-ory
remarks from our men. It came at length, and on the
morning of July 26th, at 10 A. M., the 37th Wisconsin,
after having served for nearly half its original term of
enlistment, and having spent most of that time in active
and arduous campaigning, ceased to belong to the service
of the United States. The same evening, transportation
having been duly furnished us, we took the cars on the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad for Baltimore. A detachment
of the 38th Wisconsin and the 27th Michigan occupied
the same train as we did, and as we rolled out of the
depot a cheer went up from the forty-three cars, of which
our train was composed, that wakened the echoes far and
near.</p>

<p>From Baltimore we took the Pennsylvania railroad for
Pittsburg, where the Ladies' Aid Society gave us a most
hospitable reception. From Pittsburg, through the winding
glens of Pennsylvania, and over the teeming fields of
Ohio, till at length, tired, dusty, and hungry, at two
o'clock in the morning we sweep into the evergreen city
of Cleveland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Here too, the ladies, God bless them, are on hand with
a first rate breakfast ready and waiting for us. After a
short delay we embarked on board the <i>Morning Star</i>,
and made a quick and pleasant run across Lake Erie and
through the St. Clair river, till at length we cited the old
fashioned looking buildings of Sandwich and Windsor,
looking sleepily and wonderingly at the bustling, lively
aspect of their opposite neighbor, Detroit.</p>

<p>Here we came in for a share of the kind and hearty
welcome that awaited the 27th Michigan, and here we
took leave of that regiment. For over a year we had
served in the same brigade; for over a year the 37th
"Badgers" and 27th "Wolverines" had toiled, marched
and fought side by side. And it was with mutual feelings
of esteem and regret that in the streets of Detroit
we parted with our old companions in arms. Many a
hearty good-bye and God speed you were exchanged and
many promises of correspondence given and received, and
soon the cars whirled us on, through the night, to where
the ladies of Grand Haven had a good breakfast ready
for us, where they greeted us with a hearty welcome,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verse">"and hands that offer fruit and flowers,"</p>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">There too, was McBride, prince of Captains, and the famous
old <i>Detroit</i>, and with such favorable conjunction of
boat and captain, our run across the lake was safely and
expeditiously accomplished.</p>

<p>A hearty welcome met us at the City of Bricks, and
our greeting, on our return to our State, was all that
could be desired. We arrived at Madison about 4 o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in the afternoon of Monday, July 31st, were entertained
at the Railroad Depot at the expense of the State, and
were welcomed in the park around the Capitol by the
Governor, Secretary of State, Adjutant General and the
Municipal authorities of Madison. The Regiment was
then furloughed for fifteen days with orders to report, at
the expiration of that time, at Camp Randall.</p>

<p>And here we will leave them at the point from which
they started, welcomed back to a country jubilant and
exultant in a peace they themselves had helped to win,
rejoicing themselves in the prospect of seeing home and
friends once more.</p>

<p>And even as now, when their warfare is accomplished
and the victory won, we gladly sheath the sword and lay
aside the musket, so if the old Badger State ever again
calls on her sons to stand forth in her defence, none will
respond more readily than the</p>

<p>My task is almost done, and my pen runs over these
few last lines with a feeling closely akin to regret. Regret
that this, the last slight tie binding me, as one of
their number, to those to whom these pages are dedicated,
is broken with their completion; regret at my inability to
do better justice to a subject which could well task an
abler pen than mine. The labor of its compilation has
been trifling and a labor of love. To the whole of my
brother officers I return my best thanks for the assistance
they have rendered me, both in furnishing me with the
official statistics of their companies, and also for their
personal reminiscences of scenes we have passed
through together, as well as those from which I was absent.</p>

I think of Canning's answer to the clergyman when the
latter asked him, "How did you like my sermon? I endeavored
not to be tedious," and the statesman tired out
by "four heads and an application," wearily responds,
"and yet <em>you were</em>." At any rate the book goes forth,
"with all its imperfections on its head," and if it only
serve to while away a dull hour, on some future day, or
to call up a kindly memory of the "days of auld lang
syne," I shall consider that it has, fully, attained its
purpose.</p>

<p>And on this the anniversary day of our nation's birth,
we sit here in our quiet camp near Washington, overlooking
the dome of the Capitol, and the waters of that river
by whose side repose the ashes of the Father of his
country. The noisy roar of the national salute has long
ceased to awaken the echoes of the surrounding hills,
the calm quiet of evening is settling down upon us, and as
we look round and see the bright stars and stripes of our
ensign waving languidly, in the light breeze, over the
sleeping engines of war below, our thoughts travel back
down the dim, half unreal vista of the months left behind
us.</p>

<p>A year ago and treason, with its accompaniments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bloodshed and devastation, was rampant in the land. A
year ago, and we lay on our arms in front of the strongest
army, garrisoning one of the strongest fortified places
of the whole Confederacy. To-day, that flag that now
floats from a hundred places within reach of our vision,
floats once more over every State in the Union. To-day
the States are once more united&mdash;let us hope for ever.
To-day we sit here <span class="fs70">IN PEACE</span>, looking back on our past labors
and enjoying their fruits.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
